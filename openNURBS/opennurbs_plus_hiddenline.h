	// Step II.  Specify viewport
	/*
	Description:
		Set the viewport for the hidden line drawing.  	The viewport supplies the projection that determines
		the visibility of curves, and the HiddenLineDrawing coordinate system in which the resulting
		ON_HLDCurve's are represented.   The HLD-coordinate system is a right handed system
		for 3-d model space, in which the 3rd coordinate direction is the projection
		direction.  In particular the z-coordinate direction points from the scene toward the camera.
	Parameters:
		v	-[in]	viewport.  A copy of the viewport is made inside of ON_HiddenLineDrawing.
	Returns:
		true if viewport has been set
	Details:
		Only allowed before calling Draw(..).

		For perspective views the "target depth" is used to determine the scale of the results.
		The target_depth, v.TargetDistance(false), defines the target plane that is the plane
		perpendicular to the camera axis at this distance from the camera location.
		The HLD-Coordinate system is scaled 1:1 to world coordinates on the target plane.
		The HLD_coordinate system is translated in the z-direction so that the target plane
		has z=0 in HLD-coordinates.
		If you have a viewport and don't want to think about the choice of target_depth
		you might want to try:
			double near = v.FrustumNear();
			double far = v.FrustumFar();
			double target_distance = .5*(near + far);
			bool rc = v.SetFrustumNearFar( near, far, 0.0, 0.0, target_distance);
			if( rc)
				HLD.SetViewport(v);

		Another option is to leave the target_depth unset, or more explicitly call
		  v.SetTargetPoint( ON_UNSET_POINT)
		When the target point is unset, a target_depth will be computed from the geometry and used to define
		the HLD coordinate system.  

	Perspective distortion ( on perspective views only) will scale objects in front (back) of the target plane
	to be larger (smaller) in HLD-coordinates than in world coordinates.  The absolute tolerance is applied in
	HLD-coordinates so its effect depends on the target_depth setting.

	If v is a parallel projection viewport the HLD-coordinate system is the camera coordinate system of v.

	For perspective views the transformation from world coordinates to HLD-coordinates is
	a diagonal scaling of the view transformation from world to clip coordinates.
	Specifically
															[ W/2                     ]
	World_to_HLD-coordinates =	[			H/2                 ]  x World_to_clip_coordinates
															[					(f - n)/2    d  ]
															[											1.0 ]

	where W and H are the width and depth of the view frustum at the target_depth and f and  n are the
	distances to the far and near clipping plane in the viewport, d is chosen so that the target plane
	is represented as the plane z=0 in HLD-coordinates.
