Class to check the relationship between pairs of curves in a set.
Looks for pairs that overlap.  
  Only consider overlaps that start and end at curve endpoints.
  Check 5 points including endpoints
  Classify overlaps as 
    match - curves seem to be identical to within close_g0_tol
    partial - overlap starts at an endpt of one curve and ends at an endpt of the other.
              parts of each curve are not contained in the overlap
    supercurve, subcurve - one curve is contained within the other.
Looks for endpoints that are close but not close enough, wrt g0, g1, g2;
  If endpt A is within close_gx_tol of endtpt B, but not within good_gx_tol, it is reported.
g0 tol is 3d distance.
g1 tol is angle in radians
g2 tol is a percentage - if fabs(kA - kB) < tol/200*(kA + kB), then within tol
