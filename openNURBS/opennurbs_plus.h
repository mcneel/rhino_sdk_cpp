  that floating point exception occurs.  Unmasking
  exceptions is a useful debugging technique.  Never
  unmask exceptions in release code.

  conmpiler where the FPU CTRL setting is changed or floating

  run the .NET JIT, then use ON_FPU_AfterDotNetJITUse() instead

/*
Description:
  The .NET JIT (just in-time compiler) has a bug that 
  causes a floating point overflow exception if there 
  is any double constant that whose absolute value is 
  greater than 3.402823466e+38 (=FLT_MAX).
  
  The following .NET C# program demonstrates the bug in the
  Microsoft JIT compiler.

      class Program
      {
        static bool IsBigDouble(double x)
        {
          // Note: 3.402823466e+38 is the maximum value of a 32 bit IEEE float
          //return x == 3.402823466e+38; // JIT does not generate overflow exception
          //return x == 3.5e+38;         // JIT generates overflow exception
          return x == double.MaxValue;   // JIT generates overflow exception
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
          double x = 1.0;
          // When the JIT compiles IsBigDouble(), it will generate
          // an FPU overflow exception if the constant in IsBigDouble()
          // is larger than the maximum 32 bit IEEE float.
          bool rc = IsBigDouble(x);
          if ( rc )
            System.Console.WriteLine("{0} is a big double.",x);
          else
            System.Console.WriteLine("{0} is not a big double.",x);
        }
      }
  
  If you are getting warnings that code that makes calls into
  .NET code is generating FPU overflow exceptions, then bracket
  the call to code that  may call the .NET JIT with calls to
  ON_FPU_BeforeSloppyCall()/ON_FPU_AfterDotNetJITUse().
Returns:
  ON_FPU_AfterDotNetJITUse() returns true if the FPU stayed 
  clean except for an overflow exception
  since the last call to ON_FPU_BeforeSloppyCall().
Remarks:
  These functions should be used only in extreme situations
  and there should be a verbose comment in the code explaining
  why the programmer resorted to using these functions.

  Microsoft is aware of this bug and claims it is "by design".
  http://connect.microsoft.com:80/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=100718
     ...
     So in summary this behavior is by Design. In the ECMA
     spec for IL it states that IL floating point operations
     never throw exceptions. The way to detect floating point
     overflow is to use the ckfinite IL instruction after each
     floating point operation that could produce an overflow.
     ...
  Microsoft could easily fix this bug by
  1) saving the FPU CTRL state before running their JIT
  2) clearing the FPU STAT register and restoring the CTRL 
     state after running their JIT
  This amounts to 3 lines of C and less than 10 lines of assembly 
  code and is what I would expect them to do.

/*
Description:
  WPF uses NaNs for .NET properties that are not initialized
  and intentionally passes these NaNs into the FPU at various
  times. This sets the FPU's invalid operation status bit.
  Prior to November 2014, we used to alert developers that
  their code had done something wrong when the FPU's 
  invalid status bit was set.  Because we have almost no
  control over when .NET will set the invalid status bit,
  we can no longer assume that we have a bug in our code 
  when the bit is set.

  By default, we now treat the setting of invalid status bit 
  the same we we treat the inexact bit, namely it is a common
  and expected situation.

  If you are attempting to test or debug scientific computing
  code and you want to be told when something really bad
  happens on the FPU, then call ON_FPU_EnableInvalidStatusCheck(true)
  before you run your tests.

Returns:
  The value of ON_FPU_EnableInvalidStatusCheckEnabled() before
  it was set to bEnableInvalidStatusCheck.

Description:
  Check the FPU status or control.
Parameters:
  bCheckExceptionStatus - [in]

  bCheckControl - [in]
    If true, the FPU control settings are checked

  bCall_ON_Error - [in]
    If true and exception has occurred or
    the control settings have been changed,
    then ON_Error() is called.
Returns:
  true:
    The FPU status indicates no exceptions have occurred and the
    control settings match the expected values.
  false:
    The FPU status indicates exceptions have occurred or the
    FPU control settings have unexpected values.
