Description:
  Find the point on the triangle that is closest to test_point.
Parameters:
  A - [in]
  B - [in]
  C - [in]
    triangle corners.
  N - [in]
    null pointer or a nonzero unit vector perpendicular to 
    the plane of the triangle. N may have either orientation
    (+N and -N work equally as well).
    This pointer can be the address of the "a" parameter of

    If a unit length normal is not available, pass null and
    the necessary information will be calculated in this 
    function.
  test_point - [in]
  triangle_bc - [out]
    The barycentric coordinates of the point on the triangle
    that is closest to test_point. Specifically,
    triangle_bc[0] >= 0, triangle_bc[1] >= 0, triangle_bc[2] >= 0

    is the point on the triangle that is closest to test_point.
Returns:
  Zero if the triangle is degenerate.  In this case,
  valid barycentric coordinates of a point are returned,
  but there may be multiple answers.
  Non-zero if the triangle is not degenerate and triangle_bc[]
  are the barycentric coordinates of the point on the
  triangle closest to test_point.  The returned value reports
  the region of the triangles plane test_point projects to.
  If test_point projects to the interior of the triangle, 1 is

  A - [in]
  B - [in]
  C - [in]
    triangle corners.
  N - [in]
    null pointer or a nonzero unit vector perpendicular to 
    the plane of the triangle. N may have either orientation
    (+N and -N work equally as well).
    This pointer can be the address of the "a" parameter of
    an ON_TrianglePlane calculated from this triangle.
    If a unit length normal is not available, pass null and
    the necessary information will be calculated in this 
    function.
  P - [in]
  Q - [in]
    line segment ends.
  line_t - [out]
    The parameters of the intersection point(s) on the line
    segment.
  triangle_bc - [out]
    The barycentric coordinates of the intersection point(s)
    on the triangle.
Returns:
  0: no intersection
  1: single point of intersection
  2: overlap intersection

  2: overlap intersection
     All line_t and triangle_bc values are set and
