/* WARNING: DO NOT INCLUDE THIS FILE WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF OPENNURBS OR IN THE RHINO SDK */

/* PURPOSE: this file is used to expose functions that are normally not part of the
            API of opennurbs, with the purpose of being able to unit tests such
            functions as part of the build.

   USAGE:   Include the function signatures prepended with ON_DECL to export the
            function in the opennurbs library. This will allow the tests to call
            the function directly.

   DEFINES: This file defines the symbol ON_TESTS_BUILD which you can use to fine
            tune your code.
